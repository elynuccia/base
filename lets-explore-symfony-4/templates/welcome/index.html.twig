                        <p>The <b>BASE Application</b> is an evidence-based tool to promote the Positive Behaviour Support at school. <br>
                            It aimed at response to the European requirement of reforming the whole scholastic disciplinary system to offer students the opportunity to experience the school context as socially predictable, consistent, safe and positive where norm-violating behaviour is minimized, and prosocial behaviour is promoted. <br>
                        <div align="left"> The responsive BASE application includes transversal features for supporting the creation of a PBS Team and the management of different PBS process at the three tier levels. The PBS team members and teachers are able to carry out evidence-based and proactive use of the BASE system for:

                            <ul>

                            <li> planning and collecting of children behavioural data using the measurement tool provided by the system</li>
                            <li> viewing of the school’s data and behavioral observation data;</li>
                            <li> children access for visualizing of positive behavioural progresses and privileges access request;</li>
                        </ul></div>

                            The Base application is an output of the BASE project aimed to implement and to disseminate a PBS school program, to support gathering of comparable data from school of different countries; comparing intervention effects at the three different levels: school-wide, classroom, and single student; experimenting standards for procedures and data structures; constructing and sustaining communities of people involved in the spread of the PBS approach. <br>
